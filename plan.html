<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>

<h2>Name: </h2>

<p>Bonnie Gilsenan</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>The point of this website is to increase the number of customers of Slammers by advertising what they do over the internet, 
    with <cite>what they do</cite> being beach volleyball matches.
    This is highly recommended to also assist with the hassle of signing up teams as well as announcing the times of the matches by having all the information go to one place and eliminating the risk of human error. 
    The website should also help attract more people to simply come and watch the competitions, as well as being encouraged to get involved.</p>

<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>

<p>The success of the website can be measured in how many games were arranged via online, 
    as well as if there is observation of a significant increase in either competitors or watchers sitting on the sidelines. </p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>

<p>The target audience for the site is around 35 – 50, as most customers of Slammers are recorded as being in this age group. 
    However, the site will also be aimed at younger people as well, high school students and young adults, 
    to encourage them to play while they’re still in school. 
    <br><br>This appeal shall be achieved by designing a smart but fun site, with straight-forward navigation and no unnecessary words, 
    as well as bright colours, to reference the seaside background of beach volleyball. 
    <br><br>The colours will appeal to the younger generation, while the older customers will appreciate the simplicity of the 
    site and not having to worry about trying to navigate the site.
